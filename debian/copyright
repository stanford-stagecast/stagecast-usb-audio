The ALSA snd_usb_audio kernel module is part of the Linux kernel.

This package was put together by Keith Winstein, from sources
retreived from upstream Linux git and an example from Alberto
Aguirre. The sources may be found at most Linux ftp sites, including
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/, and the prior package is
available at https://github.com/albaguirre/snd-usb-audio-dkms
